    <td>When I built the blog it mostly went well, but I encountered various problems with syntax, so I had to edit aspects of the html for the blog to work.

This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.</td>
